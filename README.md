source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install Python dependencies**:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn httpx
```

4. **Start the backend server**:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

5. **Open the frontend**:
   - Navigate to the project directory
   - Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser
   - Or serve it through a local HTTP server

## üéÆ How to Use the Application

### Selecting Pok√©mon

1. Use the dropdown menus to select two Pok√©mon from the available options
2. Their information will automatically load and display in the info cards

### Simulating a Battle

1. Click the **"Simulate Battle"** button to run the battle simulation on the server
2. The battle log will show "Simulating battle..." while processing

### Watching the Battle

1. After simulation completes, click the **"Auto Play"** button
2. Watch the animated battle unfold in the battle stage area
3. Follow the action in the battle log text area

### Resetting

1. Click **"Reset"** to clear the current battle and select new Pok√©mon
2. Changing either Pok√©mon selection will also reset the battle

## üîß API Reference

### Base URL
All endpoints are served from `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Simulate Battle

      "text": "Battle Over. Winner: Pikachu"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üß† Battle Mechanics

The simulation implements several key Pok√©mon battle mechanics:

### Type Effectiveness
The system calculates damage multipliers based on Pok√©mon types:
- Super effective: 2√ó damage
- Not very effective: 0.5√ó damage
- No effect: 0√ó damage

### STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus)
Moves matching the Pok√©mon's type get a 1.5√ó damage bonus

### Damage Calculation
Damage is calculated using this formula:
```
Damage = (((2 √ó Level / 5 + 2) √ó Power √ó Attack / Defense) / 50 + 2) √ó TypeMultiplier √ó STAB √ó RandomFactor
```

### Turn Order
Pok√©mon with higher Speed stats attack first

## üé® Frontend Features

### Dynamic UI Elements
- Real-time HP bars with color changes (green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí red)
- Animated sprites for attacks and hits
- Victory confetti animation for the winner
- Interactive battle log with auto-scrolling

### Audio Feedback
- Attack sounds during battle sequences
- Faint sound when a Pok√©mon is defeated

### Responsive Design
- Works on desktop and mobile devices
- Pok√©mon info cards adapt to different screen sizes

## üîÆ Customization

### Adding More Pok√©mon
Edit the `pokemonList` array in `app.js` to include additional Pok√©mon:

```javascript
const pokemonList = [
  'pikachu', 'bulbasaur', 'charmander', 'squirtle', 
  'eevee', 'snorlax', 'jigglypuff', // ... add more here
];
```

### Modifying Battle Rules
Adjust battle parameters in `main.py`:
- Type effectiveness chart in `TYPE_EFFECTIVENESS`
- Damage calculation in `calculate_damage()`
- Move selection logic in `choose_move()`

### Customizing UI
Modify CSS in `index.html` to change:
- Color scheme
- Animation timing
- Layout and spacing

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS errors**: Ensure the backend server is running on port 8000
2. **Pok√©mon not loading**: Check your internet connection as data is fetched from PokeAPI
3. **Battles not simulating**: Verify both Pok√©mon are selected before simulating

### Debug Mode
Start the server with increased logging:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --log-level debug
```

Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors.

## üìù Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add more battle mechanics (status effects, critical hits)
- [ ] Implement player-vs-player battles
- [ ] Add more Pok√©mon and moves
- [ ] Create a mobile app version
- [ ] Add save/load battle functionality
- [ ] Implement AI opponent strategies
